They have a sense of the author's thoughtful and serious attitude to the world around him, where everything is of value to him: nature, the architecture of his hometown, its canals and bridges, the interiors of a house inspired by human presence. V. Romanov's compositions are verified, clearly constructed; they often have some rigour, even severity; sometimes they strike the viewer with their strangeness, with a Piranesi-like fantasy whereas sometimes it is their classical clarity that impresses. The complex mixed technique used by the artist allows him to create expressive works exquisite in terms of colour, the works that always bear an imprint of his mood.»\",\r\n                    cite: \"Tamara Bukovskaya, poet, essayist, author of articles on the problems of modern fine art.\"\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    text: \"«Vladimir Romanov's works are meaningful, emotional and beautiful.
